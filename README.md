Automatic Number Plate Detection with OpenCV and Python!

Overview
This project leverages the power of OpenCV and Python to implement an Automatic Number Plate Detection (ANPR) system. The primary goal is to detect and extract license plate information from images or video streams, making it a valuable tool for applications like traffic monitoring, security surveillance, and more.

Features
OpenCV Integration: Utilizes the robust computer vision capabilities of OpenCV for image processing and analysis.

Python Implementation: Developed entirely in Python, ensuring ease of use, flexibility, and compatibility across platforms.

License Plate Detection: Detects and localizes license plates within images or video frames.

Text Extraction: Utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text information from the detected license plates.

Configurability: Adjustable parameters for fine-tuning the detection algorithm based on specific requirements.
